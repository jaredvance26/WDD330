      <h2>Form Validation</h2>
      <p>
        There are 2 main forms of validation. Client-side is done through the
        Frontend. That is making inputs required, and setting patterns so that
        the write info can get sent through. Then there is server-side
        validation. This is done through the Backend.
      </p>
      <p>
        Validation is important and should have BOTH client and server side
        validation. But since this is a frontend class, we will just primarily
        focus on client-side validation
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML has already many built in validation functions. By just adding a
        <code> required </code> prop to an input, the user won't be able to move
        on without entering something. Then there are patters using REGEXP which
        can make sure that the input is formatted correctly.
      </p>

      <h2>Fetch</h2>
      <p>
        Fetch is used commonly when trying to fetch data from an API. If you
        have an API	 sending back JSON data, then we have to fetch it, convert it
        to a JSON string, and then we can use the data.
