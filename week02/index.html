    <h1>Fizz Buzz Exercise</h1>
    <p>
      Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to
      100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead
      of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz"
      instead When you have that working, modify your program to print
      "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print
      "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Modified: </strong> I created an input for a number and when you
      press the button, it will output if its "FizzBuzz", "Fizz", or "Buzz".
    </p>
    <h3>Enter Number</h3>
    <input type="number" class="number" />
    <button class="calculate">Calculate FizzBuzz</button>
    <div class="fizzbuzz"></div>
