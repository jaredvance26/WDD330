      <h2>Function Call Method</h2>
      <p>
        In a function, you can use <code>this</code> to call out values from an
        object
      </p>
      <p>Here is an example:</p>
      <img src="images/call.png" alt="call function example" />
      <p>This would log in the console "Hey jared"</p>
      <p>
        You can even do with if the function has a required arg. This would log
        Good afternoon Jared!
      </p>
      <img src="images/call2.png" alt="call 2 function example" />

      <h2>Memoization</h2>
      <p>
        Memoization is a useful process that can make a function more efficient.
        It is basically te process of saving the argument in cache rather than
        going the the function again.

      <h2>Ajax</h2>
      <p>
        Internet is separated into clients and servers. An internet browser is a
        client and it requests from the server to display to the user. JS was
        designed for client side programming but with Ajax, can get things from
        the server. Usually in the form of JSON data.
